# Session 1

## Overview

In today's coding session, we're going to be working on some of the basics of the workflow that we're going to be using for the rest of the semester.

Much of this will build on the coding workshops you did in semester 1, especially the Python programming workshops that you did with me.

For some of you, this material might be pretty old-school already, and that's fine. If you feel like you're a comfortable with everything here, use the time to help your clasddsmates get up to speed.
